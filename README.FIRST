Pete Neville provided the initial implementation and the inspiration for those
of us who followed.  Meanwhile the environment in which the MythRokuPlayer
must function has changed dramatically:
- MythTV changed the way they store Date information
- PHP allows better handling of object dereference
- The Roku device has undergone 3 major revisions

To those looking to try out MythRokuPlayer, we welcome you.
